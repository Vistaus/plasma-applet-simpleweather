# Simple Weather Widget

https://store.kde.org/p/1287571/

A simple desktop weather widget based on the default KDE widget that shows the current temp, forecast, and min/max temperature.

While useful for users, this can also serve as an example widget for other developers to use as a starting point to create their own weather widget.
